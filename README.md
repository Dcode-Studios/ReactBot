# ReactBot
A simple reaction role Discord bot.

You should create a `config.json` and it should have the following:
```json
{
  "prefix":"!",
  "token":"BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

This bot is just a side project and is based off the reaction role part of [Archiver](https://github.com/Justice-Bots-Devs/Archiver-Bot)
